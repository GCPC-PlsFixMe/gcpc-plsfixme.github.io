## 🚀 Local Development

Since the site is static, you can develop locally without a build step.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Serve the folder** with a simple static server to avoid `file://` CORS quirks:

    - **Python**
      ```bash
      python -m http.server 8080
      ```
    - **Node (if installed)**
      ```bash
      npx serve -p 8080
      ```

3.  **Visit `http://localhost:8080`** and start iterating.

> **Note**: Opening `index.html` directly in a browser works for most features.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Site-wide values, such as statistics targets and animation durations, are located in `js/config.js`.

- **📊 Stats Animation**: `CONFIG.stats` maps counters to their target values and durations.
- **⏱️ Timing & Easing**: Smooth, visually pleasing transitions are handled in `js/main.js` (see `animateStats()` and `setupScrollAnimations()`).

---

## 🎨 Visuals: Node Graph

The animated background is implemented in `js/nodeGraph.js` using the Canvas 2D API. Nodes drift subtly and connect with lines whose opacity varies by distance, creating a calm, neon network feel.

- **⚡ Performance**: Utilizes batches of lightweight draw calls and a tuned node count based on canvas area.
- **🖌️ Aesthetic**: Features cyan/magenta nodes, faint connecting lines, and gentle motion.

---

## ♿ Accessibility & UX

- **⌨️ Keyboard Support**: Core interactions do not require a mouse.
- **🌈 Color/Contrast**: A dark theme with neon accents ensures text remains readable.
- **🏃‍♂️ Reduced Motion**: Animations are modest. Please open an issue if you need further accommodations.
